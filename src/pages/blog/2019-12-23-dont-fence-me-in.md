*<hr>*

*Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above*\
*Don't fence me in*\
*Let me ride through the wild open country that I love*\
*Don't fence me in*\
\
*Let me be by myself in the evening breeze*\
*Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees*\
*Send me off forever, but I ask you please*\
*Don't fence me in*\
\
*Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle*\
*Underneath the western skies*\
*On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder*\
*Till I see the mountains rise*\
\
*I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences*\
*And gaze at the moon until I lose my senses*\
*I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences*\
*Don't fence me in*\
\
*Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above*\
*Don't fence me in*\
*Let me ride through the wild open country that I love*\
*Don't fence me in*
