1. You're glasses are always getting dirty.

   Seriously, you have clean them like 50 times a day. Tip: if you run out of normal cleaner, use window washer! And if you wear a mask and breathe heavily, its the end of seeing right.

   2. People always insist of borrowing your glasses for NO APPARENT REASON.

   Seriously, people always want to try on your glasses. If you have let anyone borrow your glasses, you have probably heard the phrase "WOW, you are blind!" 

   3. If you take off your glasses and go anywhere, people won't recognize you.

   I'm not sure I reallly have to explain this.

   Hope you enjoyed the video version of this!
